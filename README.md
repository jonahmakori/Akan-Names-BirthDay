# THE AKAN-SYSTEM OF NAMING IN GHANA
# DESCRIPTION
- This website is about how the naming of the new-born      babies in Ghana was determined. It was simply by          inputting your birth details and the system calculates    the day you were born and the Akan-name depending on      the gender.

# BDD
- The website will require a user to fill out information   about his date of birth and the century he was was        born. The application calculates the day of the week      the user was born and outputs it. One will be required    to choose his gender and then click on the submit         button in order to generate his/her Akan name. The        application matches the day of the week with a specific   Akan Name and outputs it to the user with a               personalized message.
- <i>Note that all inputs must be in <span>Numbers</span></i>
